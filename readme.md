## Welcome

Personal website, mostly for trying out new things. Brief resume/CV, Instagram feed and videos from my travels.

## About

Work history briefly outlined.
Videos have been compressed, quality is not the best, working on a better way to stream the videos in higher definition without killing bandwidth.

Will add projects in the near future

## Installation

Multiple versions of videos are in the video folder, feel free to download and reuse.
If you wish to have higher quality, feel free to contact me.

## API's used

Instafeed.js
